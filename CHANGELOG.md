## [0.3.1] — 2026-03-13 · *Luna*

### Security
- **CRIT**: Removed encrypted `permanentPassword` field from endpoint list API response — only exposed via the explicit `GET /endpoints/:id/password` endpoint now
- **CRIT**: Restricted `GET /endpoints/:id/password` (plaintext device password) to `endpoints:write` permission — was previously readable by `READ_ONLY` / `TECHNICIAN` roles
- **CRIT**: Fixed command injection in TLS status check — `openssl s_client` domain was interpolated into a `bash -c` string; switched to positional `sh -c` args
- **HIGH**: Fixed IDOR on tenant mutation endpoints — `PATCH /tenants/:id`, `PATCH /tenants/:id/branding`, `PATCH /tenants/:id/settings`, `GET /tenants/:id/members`, `PATCH /tenants/:id/members/:userId/role`, `GET /tenants/:id/roles`, `POST /tenants/:id/invite` now verify the caller's JWT tenantId matches the URL parameter
- **HIGH**: Added rate limiting to public enrollment endpoints — `/enrollment/claim` (10/min), `/enrollment/heartbeat` (60/min) — prevents DB flood / unassigned-device queue poisoning
- **MED**: Replaced `Math.random()` with `crypto.randomBytes(16)` for logo upload filenames
- **MED**: Replaced `Math.random()` with `crypto.randomBytes(32)` for portal user stub password hash
- **LOW**: `changePassword` now enforces 12-character minimum (was 8, ignoring tenant policy)
- **LOW**: Sudoers entry for `apt-get install` restricted to `fail2ban` only — was a wildcard that allowed privilege escalation via arbitrary package install
- **GITIGNORE**: Added explicit `.env`, `*.bak`, `/tmp/` entries

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-13 · *Luna*

### Added
- **Unassigned device pool** — devices that heartbeat/enroll without a tenant token land in an unassigned state; only platform admins can see them at `/admin/unassigned`
- **Platform admin: Unassigned Devices page** — table of unassigned devices with one-click tenant assignment
- **Tenant-generated enrollment links** — "Generate Enrollment Link" button on Enrolled Clients page creates a claim token and shows per-platform script URLs (`?token=<token>`) with copy buttons
- **Auto-claim in install scripts** — when a script URL includes `?token=`, the script automatically calls `POST /enrollment/claim` after installation, assigning the device to the correct tenant
- **Claim flow: handles unassigned → assigned** — if a device heartbeated first (creating an unassigned record), the claim step assigns that record to the tenant rather than creating a duplicate
- **`GET /admin/unassigned-devices`** API endpoint (platform admin only)
- **`POST /admin/unassigned-devices/:id/assign`** API endpoint (platform admin only)

### Changed
- `RustdeskNode.rustdeskId` is now globally unique (was per-tenant) — a device can only be enrolled in one tenant at a time
- `Endpoint.tenantId` and `RustdeskNode.tenantId` are now nullable; `null` means unassigned

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-12 · *Luna*

### Added
- **Enrolled Clients** — permanent device enrollment flow with sidebar nav item, dedicated page, and "Enroll Client" button
- **Connected sessions tab** — Sessions page now has a Connected tab showing active sessions and online enrolled clients in real time (auto-refresh every 30 s)
- **Heartbeat endpoint** (`POST /enrollment/heartbeat`) — enrolled clients report presence; background job marks stale endpoints offline after 10 minutes
- **Permanent password enforcement** — install scripts now generate a 12-character random permanent password, write `verification-method = 'use-permanent-password'` to `RustDesk2.toml`, and set the password via `rustdesk --password` so clients no longer rotate session passwords
- **Unified user edit dialog** — Access page now uses a single `EditUserDialog` replacing three separate dialogs (edit profile, reset password, change role)
- **"Connected / Waiting" status** — sessions with `PENDING` status now display as "Connected / Waiting" with a pulsing green indicator instead of "Pending"
- **`GET /endpoints/connected`** API endpoint returning `isOnline=true` active endpoints with customer, site, and RustDesk node details

### Fixed
- Platform admins can now act on their own account (previously blocked by self-check order)
- Session status badge now correctly maps all uppercase DB enum values (`PENDING`, `SESSION_STARTED`, etc.)
- `@nestjs/schedule` removed — replaced with `setInterval` in `OnModuleInit`/`OnModuleDestroy` to avoid pnpm symlink issues in production deployment
