## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-25 · *Luna*

### Product model
Rem0te is a **business remote-access platform** — companies grant their users access to specific company computers. Not an RMM. Internal `tenantId` naming remains for backwards compatibility; the UI now says "Company" and "Computers."

### Added
- **`ComputerAccess` (many-to-many User ↔ Endpoint)** — migration `0004_computer_access`. Primary authorization table for "John can connect to JOHN-OFFICE-PC." Plus per-endpoint `accessMode` (`ASSIGNED_USERS` | `COMPANY_WIDE`).
- **Token-bound managed enrollment**. `DeviceClaimToken` now carries `customerId`, `accessMode`, `assignedUserIds[]`, `endpointGroupId`, `createdById`. The endpoint that redeems the token cannot influence any of these — the values are stamped on the endpoint + `ComputerAccess` atomically inside `claimEndpoint`. All `assignedUserIds` are validated at token-mint time to belong to the same tenant.
- **Path-token installer URLs** — `GET /api/v1/public/install/win/:token`, `linux/:token`, `mac/:token`. Token lives in the URL path, not a query string, so it doesn't spill into proxy logs or `Referer` headers.
- **`GET /api/v1/endpoints/mine`** — employee-facing "My Computers" endpoint. Returns only computers the caller has explicit `ComputerAccess` for (plus company-wide ones in their customer).
- **Access management API** — `GET/POST /endpoints/:id/access`, `DELETE /endpoints/:id/access/:userId`, `PATCH /endpoints/:id/access-mode`. Every action audited (`ENDPOINT_ACCESS_GRANTED`, `ENDPOINT_ACCESS_REVOKED`).
- **Web: `/endpoints/enroll` — Add Computer page.** Company + access-mode (specific users or company-wide) + platform → generates a token-bound install command. Copy-to-clipboard.
- **Web: `/my-computers` — employee view.** Shows only the computers this user has been granted access to, with a Connect button.

### Fixed
- **Windows installer wrote its config only into the service profile, so the interactive user's RustDesk GUI kept showing "For faster connection, please set up your own server."** The installer now:
  - Enumerates real user profiles from `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList` (not a naive `C:\Users` scan that swept in `Public`).
  - Writes `RustDesk2.toml` into **every** user profile that has AppData, **plus** `C:\Users\Default` so future first-logins inherit the Rem0te config.
  - Kills any user-session RustDesk GUI/tray after writing so it re-reads on next launch.
- **Effective-config verification now covers every profile, not just the SYSTEM one that ran the installer.** Detects service ↔ user divergence and repairs it before returning. Exit 20 (hard fail) if any profile is still pointing at `rustdesk.com` after repair — no more "success" on a public-server client.

### Migrations
- `0004_computer_access` — new `ComputerAccess` table + `EndpointAccessMode` enum; extends `Endpoint` with `accessMode`; extends `DeviceClaimToken` with `customerId`, `accessMode`, `assignedUserIds`, `endpointGroupId`, `createdById`.
- `0005_access_audit_events` — extends `ActivityAction` with `ENDPOINT_ACCESS_GRANTED`, `ENDPOINT_ACCESS_REVOKED`.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-25 · *Luna*

### Fixed
- **Managed Windows installer never reached our hbbs.** Root cause: RustDesk 1.4.9 did not honor the shotgun `RustDesk2.toml` writes we did across every profile — the service continued to negotiate with `rs-*.rustdesk.com`, so no device ever appeared in the Rem0te dashboard and the "For faster connection, please set up your own server" banner remained.

### Changed
- **Rewrote `GET /public/install/windows.ps1` end-to-end.** Now uses the officially supported RustDesk MSP techniques instead of file-writing:
  - Downloads the setup executable renamed to `rustdesk-host=<HOST>,key=<KEY>.exe` so RustDesk parses the server config from its own filename during install (atomic, no race).
  - After install, runs `rustdesk.exe --config <base64>` where the payload is `host=…,key=…,api=,relay=…` — updates RustDesk2.toml + rendezvous_server via the CLI, the same path an OEM build uses.
  - Deletes any stale RustDesk2.toml from prior installs before applying so an old rendezvous can't linger.
  - Also writes the LocalSystem service's `RustDesk2.toml` as belt-and-braces for older 1.4.x builds where `--config` regressed.
- **Effective-config verification.** Reads back `custom-rendezvous-server` and refuses to report success if it still matches `*.rustdesk.com`. Fails with exit code 20 instead of silently marking a public-server client as "installed."
- **Reliable device-ID retrieval.** Uses `rustdesk.exe --get-id` as the primary source, falls back to scanning the LocalSystem `RustDesk.toml`. Retries for 2 minutes rather than 45 seconds.
- **Background enrollment retry.** If ID acquisition or the API call can't complete during the installer's window, a `Rem0teEnrollment` scheduled task is installed (SYSTEM, `SC MINUTE /MO 5`) with a state file at `C:\ProgramData\Rem0te\enroll.dat` (SYSTEM/Administrators ACL only). It self-deletes as soon as enrollment succeeds, and after 24 hours regardless.
- **Non-interactive-safe.** `Read-Host` is skipped when `[Environment]::UserInteractive` is false, so RMM / Intune / GPO deployment doesn't hang. Meaningful exit codes: 0 ok, 2 not-admin, 10 download failure, 11 install failure, 20 verification failure.
- **Installer log** at `C:\ProgramData\Rem0te\Logs\install.log`. No secrets, no tokens, no passwords.
- **Password no longer displayed.** The internal RustDesk compatibility password is generated as 20 characters of URL-safe RNG on the endpoint and sent server-side over TLS via `enrollment/heartbeat` — never printed to the console, never in the log.

## [0.3.8] — 2026-08-25 · *Luna*

### Added
- **User contact and address fields.** `User` schema now carries `phone`, `jobTitle`, `address`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `postalCode`, `timeZone` (all nullable). Exposed via `PATCH /api/v1/auth/profile` (self-service) and `PATCH /api/v1/users/:id` (admin). List endpoints (`GET /api/v1/users`, `GET /api/v1/auth/profile`) return the new fields, and the customer membership row now includes its linked customer.
- **My Account page** — Profile tab redesigned with an Identity section (first/last name, email, phone, job title) and a Mailing Address section (street, city, state/region, postal code, country, time zone).
- **Installer auto-registration without an enrollment token.** All three installers (`.ps1`, Linux `.sh`, macOS `.sh`) now retry RustDesk Device ID extraction for up to 45 s and always call `POST /api/v1/enrollment/heartbeat` after installation. Devices installed without a claim token now show up under Admin → Unassigned Devices, and the encrypted permanent password travels with them so the tenant already has it when it's assigned to a customer.
- **Encrypted first-write-only password storage on heartbeat.** The public `enrollment/heartbeat` endpoint accepts an optional `password`. It is encrypted (AES-256-GCM) and written to `RustdeskNode.permanentPassword` only if the node has no password yet — a hostile heartbeat with a guessed RustDesk ID cannot rotate a live credential.

### Changed
- `HeartbeatDto` now validates `rustdeskId` (6–15 digits), bounds hostname/platform/osVersion/agentVersion string lengths, and accepts the optional `password`.
- Windows installer: better fallback UX when RustDesk fails to write its `id` file (always prints the password so the operator can enter it manually).

---

## [0.3.7] — 2026-08-25 · *Luna*

### Security
- **Notes cross-tenant comment bypass (Critical, IDOR)** — `POST /notes/:id/comments` looked notes up by id only; any authenticated user could comment on any tenant's note. Now scoped by `tenantId` and audited via `NOTE_COMMENT_ADDED`.
- **RustDesk password ciphertext leaked in endpoint responses (Critical)** — `GET /endpoints`, `GET /endpoints/:id`, and `GET /endpoints/connected` no longer return the encrypted `permanentPassword` field. Responses expose only `hasPassword: boolean`. Plaintext is available exclusively via `GET /endpoints/:id/password`, which is throttled, MFA-gated, and audited via `ENDPOINT_PASSWORD_REVEALED`.
- **ENCRYPTION_KEY silently defaulted to all-zeros (Critical)** — three services fell back to a hardcoded key if the env var was missing. Now rejected at boot by config schema and by each service.
- **In-app updater accepted unsigned GitHub tags with `sudo` (Critical)** — updater refused unless `ALLOW_IN_APP_UPDATE=true`, requires signed release tags (`git tag --verify`), rejects non-semver / downgrade versions, and runs all subprocesses via `spawn(binary, args, { shell: false })` — no `bash -c` interpolation.
- **RustdeskNode queries not tenant-scoped (High)** — `getPassword`, `setPassword`, and `setRustdeskNode` now include `tenantId` in every query and refuse to overwrite a node bound to a different tenant.
- **JWT trusted stale role and platform-admin claims (High)** — every request re-reads `user.isPlatformAdmin`, the tenant's `isActive` flag, and the caller's active membership. Revocation is honored immediately instead of at token expiry.
- **Sudoers file allowed arbitrary package install and caddy config paths (High)** — `apt-get install *`, `caddy reload *` wildcards replaced by exact command allowlist. `visudo -c` validated on install.
- **Public installer scripts interpolated tenant settings unescaped (High)** — added strict allowlist validators for host, key, token, and version before they reach PowerShell/bash strings.
- **MFA recovery-code brute-force (Medium)** — endpoint throttled to 5/min per IP + per-user in-process backoff (5 failures → 15-minute lockout, logged as `RECOVERY_CODE_LOCKOUT`).
- **Cookies not Secure in production by default (Medium)** — cookies are Secure whenever `NODE_ENV=production`, independent of the previously required `COOKIE_SECURE` env var.
- **X-Forwarded-For was implicitly trustable (Medium)** — added `TRUSTED_PROXIES` env with sane default (`loopback` = same-host Caddy). Direct clients can no longer spoof source IP.
- **Placeholder secrets accepted (Medium)** — config validation rejects `JWT_SECRET`/`LAUNCHER_TOKEN_SECRET` values matching `change_me*`.

### Fixed
- **Windows installer crashed on PowerShell 5.1** — `-ProgressAction` is PS 7.4+; replaced with `$ProgressPreference` preference var (works on 5.1 and 7+).
- **Windows installer output** — permanent password now always shown even if the RustDesk ID could not be extracted; explicit hint when no enrollment token was included in the URL.

### Added
- `pnpm --filter api security:regression` — 6-assertion Prisma-level regression suite covering the tenant-isolation and password-leak fixes (`apps/api/scripts/security-regression.mjs`).
- `GET /admin/update/version` now returns `{version, commit, buildDate, channel, latestVersion, updateAvailable, inAppUpdateEnabled}`.
- Startup log line now prints version and configured trust-proxy setting.
- Migration `0002_activity_action_additions` extends the `ActivityAction` enum with the new audit event types.
- `docs/SECURITY-AUDIT.md` — full remediation record.

### Changed
- All version sources (`version.json`, root/api/web `package.json`) synchronized on `0.3.7`.

---

## [0.3.6] — 2026-03-14 · *Luna*

### Changed
- **Windows installer** — replaced `.bat` launcher with a compiled Go `.exe` (`GET /public/install/windows.exe`); binary patching at serve time embeds the PS1 URL including any enrollment token; self-elevates via UAC, no PowerShell knowledge required; signable with a code signing certificate

### Removed
- `GET /public/install/windows.bat` — superseded by `windows.exe`

---

## [0.3.5] — 2026-03-13 · *Luna*

### Added
- **Windows one-click installer** — `GET /public/install/windows.bat` serves a self-elevating batch file; double-click requests UAC and runs the PowerShell installer automatically — no PowerShell knowledge needed
- **Download page** — Windows section now has a prominent "Download Windows Installer (.bat)" button as the primary option, with the PowerShell command as a fallback
- **Enrollment link modal** — shows the `.bat` URL as the recommended Windows option alongside existing PS1/shell script URLs

---

## [0.3.4] — 2026-03-13 · *Luna*

### Changed
- **Settings → Access Control tab** now navigates directly to the Access Control page instead of showing an intermediary card with a button

### Dependencies
- `argon2` updated 0.40.3 → 0.44.0
- `class-validator` updated 0.14.4 → 0.15.1

---

## [0.3.3] — 2026-03-13 · *Luna*

### Security
- **HIGH**: `rustdeskRelayHost` and `rustdeskPublicKey` in tenant settings now validated with `@Matches` — hostname must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9.\-]+$`, key must match base64 — prevents shell injection via crafted server config embedded in install scripts
- **MED**: `resetPassword` (admin-initiated) now enforces 12-character minimum (was 8) — consistent with `changePassword`
- **MED**: `GET /launcher/validate` now rate-limited at 20 req/min — was missing throttle decorator
- **MED**: Auth cookies (`access_token`, `partial_token`) upgraded from `SameSite: lax` to `SameSite: strict`
- **LOW**: Invite tokens now use `crypto.randomBytes(32)` instead of `nanoid(32)` — consistent with rest of codebase
- **LOW**: Device claim tokens now stored as SHA-256 hash — raw token returned to caller but only hash persisted in DB; token validated by hashing incoming value before lookup

### Fixed
- `ResetPasswordDto` missing class-validator decorators caused `forbidNonWhitelisted` to reject all admin password resets — added `@IsString()` + `@MinLength(12)` (plus decorators on `InviteUserDto`, `ChangeRoleDto`, `UpdateProfileDto`)

---

## [0.3.2] — 2026-03-13 · *Luna*

### Security
- **HIGH**: `GET /admin/status` — replaced all `execSync` calls with async `spawn`-based helpers; disk and service status checks now run concurrently and no longer block the Node.js event loop
- **HIGH**: OS update now fetches and checks out a specific release tag (`git fetch origin tag vX.Y.Z` + `git checkout vX.Y.Z`) instead of blindly pulling `origin/main` — prevents supply-chain risk from a compromised default branch
- **MED**: MFA `POST /auth/mfa/verify` now prefers the httpOnly `partial_token` cookie over any `partialToken` value supplied in the request body — eliminates token fixation via body injection
- **MED**: Launcher deep link changed from `reboot-remote://launch?token=…` (query string) to `reboot-remote://launch#token=…` (URL fragment) — JWT is no longer forwarded to servers or recorded in proxy/server access logs; Tauri launcher updated to parse from fragment

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-03-13 · *Luna*

### Security
- **CRIT**: Removed encrypted `permanentPassword` field from endpoint list API response — only exposed via the explicit `GET /endpoints/:id/password` endpoint now
- **CRIT**: Restricted `GET /endpoints/:id/password` (plaintext device password) to `endpoints:write` permission — was previously readable by `READ_ONLY` / `TECHNICIAN` roles
- **CRIT**: Fixed command injection in TLS status check — `openssl s_client` domain was interpolated into a `bash -c` string; switched to positional `sh -c` args
- **HIGH**: Fixed IDOR on tenant mutation endpoints — `PATCH /tenants/:id`, `PATCH /tenants/:id/branding`, `PATCH /tenants/:id/settings`, `GET /tenants/:id/members`, `PATCH /tenants/:id/members/:userId/role`, `GET /tenants/:id/roles`, `POST /tenants/:id/invite` now verify the caller's JWT tenantId matches the URL parameter
- **HIGH**: Added rate limiting to public enrollment endpoints — `/enrollment/claim` (10/min), `/enrollment/heartbeat` (60/min) — prevents DB flood / unassigned-device queue poisoning
- **MED**: Replaced `Math.random()` with `crypto.randomBytes(16)` for logo upload filenames
- **MED**: Replaced `Math.random()` with `crypto.randomBytes(32)` for portal user stub password hash
- **LOW**: `changePassword` now enforces 12-character minimum (was 8, ignoring tenant policy)
- **LOW**: Sudoers entry for `apt-get install` restricted to `fail2ban` only — was a wildcard that allowed privilege escalation via arbitrary package install
- **GITIGNORE**: Added explicit `.env`, `*.bak`, `/tmp/` entries

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-13 · *Luna*

### Added
- **Unassigned device pool** — devices that heartbeat/enroll without a tenant token land in an unassigned state; only platform admins can see them at `/admin/unassigned`
- **Platform admin: Unassigned Devices page** — table of unassigned devices with one-click tenant assignment
- **Tenant-generated enrollment links** — "Generate Enrollment Link" button on Enrolled Clients page creates a claim token and shows per-platform script URLs (`?token=<token>`) with copy buttons
- **Auto-claim in install scripts** — when a script URL includes `?token=`, the script automatically calls `POST /enrollment/claim` after installation, assigning the device to the correct tenant
- **Claim flow: handles unassigned → assigned** — if a device heartbeated first (creating an unassigned record), the claim step assigns that record to the tenant rather than creating a duplicate
- **`GET /admin/unassigned-devices`** API endpoint (platform admin only)
- **`POST /admin/unassigned-devices/:id/assign`** API endpoint (platform admin only)

### Changed
- `RustdeskNode.rustdeskId` is now globally unique (was per-tenant) — a device can only be enrolled in one tenant at a time
- `Endpoint.tenantId` and `RustdeskNode.tenantId` are now nullable; `null` means unassigned

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-12 · *Luna*

### Added
- **Enrolled Clients** — permanent device enrollment flow with sidebar nav item, dedicated page, and "Enroll Client" button
- **Connected sessions tab** — Sessions page now has a Connected tab showing active sessions and online enrolled clients in real time (auto-refresh every 30 s)
- **Heartbeat endpoint** (`POST /enrollment/heartbeat`) — enrolled clients report presence; background job marks stale endpoints offline after 10 minutes
- **Permanent password enforcement** — install scripts now generate a 12-character random permanent password, write `verification-method = 'use-permanent-password'` to `RustDesk2.toml`, and set the password via `rustdesk --password` so clients no longer rotate session passwords
- **Unified user edit dialog** — Access page now uses a single `EditUserDialog` replacing three separate dialogs (edit profile, reset password, change role)
- **"Connected / Waiting" status** — sessions with `PENDING` status now display as "Connected / Waiting" with a pulsing green indicator instead of "Pending"
- **`GET /endpoints/connected`** API endpoint returning `isOnline=true` active endpoints with customer, site, and RustDesk node details

### Fixed
- Platform admins can now act on their own account (previously blocked by self-check order)
- Session status badge now correctly maps all uppercase DB enum values (`PENDING`, `SESSION_STARTED`, etc.)
- `@nestjs/schedule` removed — replaced with `setInterval` in `OnModuleInit`/`OnModuleDestroy` to avoid pnpm symlink issues in production deployment

---
